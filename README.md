## 📖 Overview

Laptop Mart Multan v3 is a sleek, client-side web application designed to serve as an interactive product catalog for a laptop retail store. It focuses on delivering a smooth user experience by presenting a wide range of laptops with dynamic filtering and search capabilities.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project up and running on your machine.

### Prerequisites
-   **Node.js**: Required for `npm` (Node Package Manager) to install and manage project dependencies and run the Tailwind CSS build process.
    -   You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/officialmuneebahmad/LMM_v3.git
    cd LMM_v3
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**
    Use npm to install the necessary development dependencies (Tailwind CSS, PostCSS).
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the Tailwind CSS development process**
    This command watches for changes in your CSS files and rebuilds `output.css` with Tailwind styles.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    _Note: Keep this command running in a separate terminal while developing._

4.  **Serve the application**
    Since this is a client-side application, you'll need a simple static file server to view it in your browser.
    If you have Visual Studio Code, the "Live Server" extension is highly recommended. Otherwise, you can use `http-server` via npm:
    ```bash
    # Install http-server globally if you don't have it
    npm install -g http-server

    # Navigate to the project root and run
    http-server
    ```

5.  **Open your browser**
    Visit `http://localhost:[detected-port]` (e.g., `http://localhost:8080` or the port provided by Live Server/http-server).

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Tailwind CSS
The core styling of this project is managed by Tailwind CSS. While `tailwind.config.js` is not explicitly listed, it is implied by the use of `tailwindcss` and `postcss`. If you wish to customize Tailwind's default behavior (e.g., colors, spacing, breakpoints), you would typically create or modify a `tailwind.config.js` file at the root of the project.

### Data Source
The application uses `laptops1.json` as its primary data source for laptop products. You can modify this file to update the product inventory or add new items.

## 🔧 Development

### Available Scripts
The `package.json` includes the following script:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Compiles Tailwind CSS from `input.css` (or internal sources) to `output.css` and watches for changes, automatically rebuilding on file modifications. |

### Development Workflow
1.  Run `npm run dev` in one terminal to continuously compile your Tailwind CSS.
2.  Serve `index.html` using a local static server (e.g., Live Server extension for VS Code or `http-server`).
3.  Make changes to `index.html`, `script.js`, `footer.js`, or your CSS (if you have an `input.css` or similar source).
4.  The browser will automatically refresh (if using Live Server) or you can manually refresh to see your changes.

## 🚀 Deployment

This project is a static client-side application, making it straightforward to deploy. The `homepage` field in the repository metadata indicates deployment on Vercel.

### Production Build (CSS)
While there's no complex JavaScript bundling, for production, you might want to optimize your Tailwind CSS to remove unused styles (tree-shaking). This is automatically handled by PostCSS during the build process, often configured to purge unused CSS when `NODE_ENV` is set to `production`.

To create a production-optimized `output.css`:
```bash
NODE_ENV=production npm run dev
# You might need a dedicated build script for production if not automatically handled by `dev`
# If there were a `build` script in package.json, it would typically be:
# npm run build
```

### Deployment Options
-   **Vercel**: Given the `homepage` URL, Vercel is a natural choice. Simply link your GitHub repository to Vercel, and it will automatically detect and deploy your static site.
-   **Netlify**: Similar to Vercel, Netlify offers seamless integration with GitHub for static site deployment.
-   **GitHub Pages**: Push your code to a `gh-pages` branch or configure your main branch to serve as a static site.
-   **Any Static Hosting Provider**: Upload the entire project directory (including `index.html`, `script.js`, `output.css`, `laptops1.json`) to any web server or CDN.
